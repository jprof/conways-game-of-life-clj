## Usage

There are currently two ways to interact with this program.

1. Invoking `lein run` will run the code in main.clj, which is a loop taking
   the input specified in the above link and returning the next game of life
   position.

2. Using the ClojureScript build available [here][2]. This is an interactive,
   fixed size board that you can toggle the cells and compute the next
   position.
